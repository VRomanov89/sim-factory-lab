    excerpt: 'Our journey begins with monitoring a single machine to understand the fundamentals of industrial automation.',
    content: `# Our First Project

We're starting Sim Factory Lab by focusing on a single machine. This approach allows us to:

- Understand the basics of machine monitoring
- Learn about different protocols (Modbus, OPC UA)
- Build a solid foundation for scaling up

## Why Start Small?

Industrial automation can be overwhelming. By starting with one machine, we can:

1. **Learn the fundamentals** - Understanding how machines communicate
2. **Test our assumptions** - Validating our approach before scaling
3. **Build confidence** - Proving our concept works in practice

## Next Steps

Once we have the first machine working, we'll expand to:
- Multiple machines
- Data visualization
- Predictive maintenance

Stay tuned for updates on our progress!`

    title: 'Choosing Our Technology Stack',
    date: '2025-01-25',
    excerpt: 'A deep dive into the technologies we\'re selecting for our industrial automation platform.',
    content: `# Technology Stack Selection

After extensive research, we've chosen our technology stack for Sim Factory Lab.

## Long-term Vision

Our complete stack will include:

### Hardware Layer
- **PLCs** - Programmable Logic Controllers for machine control
- **HMIs** - Human Machine Interfaces for operator interaction
- **Sensors** - Various sensors for data collection

### Software Layer
- **SCADA** - Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
- **MES** - Manufacturing Execution System
- **Historian** - Data storage and analysis

## MVP Approach

For our minimum viable product, we're starting with:
- Simple machine monitoring
- Basic data collection
- Web-based dashboard

This allows us to validate our approach before investing in complex systems.

## Why This Matters

The right technology stack is crucial for:
- Scalability
- Reliability
- Cost-effectiveness
- Future growth

We'll share more details about each component as we implement them.`
